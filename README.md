# Visualizing and Analyzing Earnings Based On College Majors  

This is a **Guided Project** form DataQuest.

In this project I have made visualization and done analysis on people with different college majors.   
* Below are some conclusions I came up with :-

## Conclusions :-
### Do students in more popular majors make more money?  
* **NO**, there no correlation between the popularity of a major and median salary.  

### Do students that majored in subjects that were majority female make more money?  
* **NO**, instead a **weak inverse correlation** was seen between Median Salary and Share of Women.  

### Is there any link between the number of full-time employees and median salary?
* **NO**, there is no relation between Full-time employees and Median Salary.
